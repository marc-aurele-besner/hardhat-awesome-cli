## Helper tools
Tools that you can use in your scripts and tests to make your life easier

### Address Book

Create (if it does not exist) contractsAddressDeployed.json and contractsAddressDeployedHistory.json to store all the contracts you deployed, with the name of the contract, the contract address, the network name, the deployer address and the deployment date. The first file (contractsAddressDeployed.json) stores only the last contract for a given contract name and network name, while the second file (contractsAddressDeployedHistory.json) keeps a log of all the contracts deployed.

You can then retrieve your contract address in your tests scripts to run test on deployed contracts on live chains for example.

Import:
javascript
```
const { addressBook, network } = require('hardhat')
```
typescript
```
import { addressBook, network } from 'hardhat'
```

Usage:
```
addressBook.saveContract(contractName: string, contractAddress: string, deployedNetwork: string, deployedBy: string, blockHah?: string, blockNumber?: number, tag?: string, extra?: any)

addressBook.retrieveContract(contractName: string, deployedNetwork: string)
```

Example:
```
await addressBook.saveContract('MockERC20', mockERC20.address, network.name, deployer.address)

await addressBook.retrieveContract('MockERC20', network.name)
```

Return:
```
address: string
```

Retrieve a deployed contract object

Usage:
```

addressBook.retrieveContractObject(contractName: string, deployedNetwork: string)
```

Example:
```

await addressBook.retrieveContractObject('MockERC20', network.name)
```

Return:
```
{
    name: string
    address: string
    network: string
    deployer: string
    deploymentDate: Date
    blockHah?: string
    blockNumber?: number
    tag?: string
    extra?: any
}
```

Retrieve Admin Proxy contract address deployed by @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades library

Usage:
```

addressBook.retrieveOZAdminProxyContract(chainId: number)
```

Example:
```

await addressBook.retrieveOZAdminProxyContract(network.config.chainId)
```

Return:
```
address: string
```

Retrieve all contracts deployed for a network name

Usage:
```

addressBook.retrieveContractHistory(deployedNetwork: string)
```

Example:
```

await addressBook.retrieveContractHistory(network.name)
```

Return:
```
[
    {
        name: string
        address: string
        network: string
        deployer: string
        deploymentDate: Date
        blockHah?: string
        blockNumber?: number
    }
]
```

    - Offer to create deployment scripts (use addressBook.saveContract() to save the deployed contract in contractsAddressDeployed.json and contractsAddressDeployedHistory.json)
    - Offer to create test scripts
    - Offer to create Foundry/Forge test contracts
- Tool to log all contracts deploy on each chain (1 unique contractName/chain + full log) and retrieve them (not tested yet)
    - hre.addressBook.{ saveContract, retrieveContract, retrieveContractObject, retrieveOZAdminProxyContract, retrieveContractHistory }
- Flatten your contracts (All contracts, or specific contracts) save in contractsFlatten/
- Write some test on the package using mocha

</details>

## üèóÔ∏è To do:
- Improving documentation
- Deployment contract generator
- More Settings:
    - Handle directory for file exception
    - Setup slack API or email report to receive a copy of test result and contracts list deployed
    - Create a custom command
- Improve all the tests, to test transfer, mint, burn (all basic ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 functions)
- Add test for AdminProxy and TransparentUpgradeableProxy
- Offer to rename the Mock contract and set all constructor input (or initialize input) via cli
    - Verify that the input name does not conflict with inheritance
    - Rename the Mock file, contract name, deployment script, test scripts (and the test values)
- Write more test with mocha to test the package functionality
- Create contracts/, test/ and scripts/ folder if they don't exist when adding mock contracts
- Remove package from hardhat config when remove
