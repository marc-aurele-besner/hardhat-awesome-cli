## Helper tools
Tools that you can use in your scripts and tests to make your life easier

### Address Book

Import:
js```
const { addressBook } = require('hardhat')
```
typescript```
import { addressBook } from 'hardhat'
```

Usage:
```
addressBook.saveContract(contractName: string, contractAddress: string, deployedNetwork: string, deployedBy: string)

addressBook.retrieveContract(contractName: string, deployedNetwork: string)
```

Example:
```
await addressBook.saveContract('MockERC20', MockERC20.address, 'ethereum', deployer.address)

await addressBook.retrieveContract('MockERC20', 'ethereum')
```

## üí™ Done
- Run test on all or single test file (from all your file in test/)
- Run scripts  on all or single scripts file (from all your file in scripts/)
- Setup chains, RPC and accounts:
    - Activate/Disable chain to show on test/scripts options
    - Build .env file with rpc url and private key (or mnemonic)
- More settings
    - Exclude files from, tests and scripts selection (useful for config and share helper file)
- Create Mock contracts (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 + Upgradeable version)
    - Add @openzeppelin/contracts || @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable if not already installed
- Tool to log all contracts deploy on each chain (1 unique contractName/chain + full log) and retrieve them (not tested yet)
    - hre.addressBook.{ saveContract, retrieveContract }


## üèóÔ∏è To do:
- Start working on documentation
- Inject chain settings, rpc and accounts in hardhat.config
- Offer to generate deployment script and test script for Mock contract created
- Deployment contract generator
- Make 'Run coverage tests' available only if task is exported by hardhat
- Run coverage test (if solidity-coverage is installed)
- Setup chains, RPC and accounts:
    - Disabling chains seams to be broken
    - See list of .env config and chains setup in a table
- More Settings:
    - Create github workflows file to run test and coverage test
    - Setup slack API or email report to receive a copy of test result and contracts list deployed
    - Add other hardhat plugins
    - Create custom command
- Add option to create Admin Proxy and Transparent proxy w/ appropriate deployment scripts
